Zillow has a data page:

Looks like there is data by neighborhood - they only withold the individual home data. The neighborhood level data might be sufficient to correlate with the yelp reviews and do something interesting.

Zillow + Yelp are ideal tools to look for gentrification. Are yelp reviews in gentrifying areas significantly different? What kinds of restaurants exist in gentrifying areas? Number of Yelp users is probably a good handle on gentrification.

ZHVI data is from 1996 to present on 5923 neighborhoods. Wowza! Linear models cannot be used on this dataset, polynomial fits will have to be attempted. We really need a function that finds the date of the yelp review and takes the derivative of it.

TODO:
For a given Yelp review, get date, location, and stars.
For a given location and time, get the ZHVI derivative at that moment.
