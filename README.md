Economics research with Professor John Clithero.

In this project, Franklin, Dr Clithero and I worked with data gathered from Yelp and Zillow and we analyzed the relationship and interconnection between neighborhood hosing prices and business reviews. 

Our most significant finding is that, when we first group the restaurants by dollor bins, the 4 dollor sign (very expensive) restaurants tend to get worse and worse reviews if they are located in a poor neighborhood. Also, 4 dollar-sign restaurants in general are experiencing a decrease in ratings from 2006 to 2016.
