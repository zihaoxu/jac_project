\section{Introduction} \label{introduction}

Yelp Dataset Papers:

\citep{alghunaim2015vector,byers2012groupon,cawkwell2015tracking,chepurna2015exploiting,feng2013recommendation,gutierrez2014noise,hajas2014analysis,hu2014your,liu2015mining,mashhadi2012accuracy,quattrone2015there}

Zillow Dataset Papers:

Has previously been combined with the yelp dataset \citet{bonnarlittle}.

Our goal is to use the correlation of two time-series:

1. The monthly median rent, as tracked by Zillow Rental Data.
2. The median restaurant review rating (stars) for each restaurant in a neighborhood.

Zillow rental data can be used to detect appreciating, and depreciating neighborhoods.

As rents rise in a given neighborhood, which types of businesses fare / worse better in the reviews? 
As rents fall in a given neighborhood, which types of business fare / worse better in the reviews?

We hope to present concrete suggestions to restaurant owners to improve the survivability of their businesses in times of strong appreciation / depreciation in the housing market.

\section{Data} \label{Data}

\subsection{Yelp Academic Dataset} \label{Yelp Academic Dataset}

The Yelp Academic Dataset contains five files.

\subsection{Zillow Public Dataset} \label{Zillow Public Dataset}

The Zillow Public Dataset (hereafter Zillow dataset) contains many files.

Zillow divides homes into geographic ``neighborhoods" with well defined boundaries. The ZHVI, and rental data is reported for every neighborhood, on a monthly basis.

\section{Methods} \label{Methods}

\subsection{Combination of Datasets} \label{Combination of Datasets}

Each Yelp business is tagged with a geographic (latitude, longitude) coordinate. Each Zillow neighborhood has geographic boundaries. We sort each Yelp business into its appropriate Zillow neighborhood.

\subsection{Determination of Most Common Yelp Tags} \label{Determination of Most Common Yelp Tags}

Each Yelp business has user-generated tags, that allow other users to determine what genre the business is. For restaurants, common tags are "Mexican", "Chinese", etc.
